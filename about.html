	T-Cypher is from New England born and raised. Born in 1997, living forever.
	T-Cypher claims to be hard to read and unpredictable, but at the same time
	seems to be rather outgoing and open about everything. He tries to rap to
	inspire, motivate, and tell stories with deeper meaning. In his songs, he talks about
	feelings, experiences, relationships, and thoughts he has everyday. T-Cypher started
	rapping in 2012, but only began writing in 2015 and producing in 2016. When he 
	first began producing his work, it was quite provocative and demeaning. He realized 
	early on that what he rapped about was fake and not who he was. Thinking that
	he wanted to change the way rap works, he changed his whole style. Now, he does not show
	his face on social media, videos, pictures, or shows. He does this to show that
	its not about who you are, its about what you do and how you do it. He says the cliche
	New England word "WICKED" as a moto for people, (kids mostly) to get his point across.
	He spells it backwards, DEK.CIW, and uses it as an acronym meaning- DO EVERYTHING KIDS.
	CAUSE IMAGINATION WORKS.
